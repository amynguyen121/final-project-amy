Type in Action

Statement:
Type in Action is an interactive type specimen, which not only showcase the design but also allow the audience to interact with the typeface in through sound, color and 3D view. 

Summary:
The project includes different built in interaction to showcase a typeface, I designed, in a nontraditional way. The original 2D typeface will be transformed into 3D shapes, with Maya, and exported out as OBJ files. These OBJ files will be imported into P5, where I will build all the interactive components. There will be three different interactions to this project. The first interaction is 3D view, which will be trolled by the mouse’s position. As the users move their mouse across the screen, the 3D type will rotate and reveal different sides on the shapes. The second interaction will be controlled by the keyboard. The static 3D letters are displaced in the same color on the screen. Once the user hit a letter on the keyboard the same 3D letter will change its color, the colors are random and different for each letter. And the last interaction is sound effect, which will also be controlled by the keyboard. As the user hit a letter on the keyboard, a different sound will played. The sound effects are different for every letters. 

Component parts:
_ Original typeface
_ 3D letters
_ Sound effects  

Project Update:
As I'm working on this project, I have ran into a few challenges with keyboard interaction. For the sake of the project and the tight dealine, I decided to keep my interaction within the mouse function. Instead of using keyboard to change the type's color, I used the mouse position to change spotlight position, which gave a effect of changing color on 3D model. I also adding particals, which mimic the visual effect of the original type specimen,on mouse click.
